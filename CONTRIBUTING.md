# Contributing to DjangoAdminGeomap library
This project use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

You can make contributing to this project, whether it's:

-   Reporting a bug using [Github issues](https://github.com/vb64/django.admin.geomap/issues)
-   Proposing new features using [Github issues](https://github.com/vb64/django.admin.geomap/issues)
-   Submitting a code using [Github Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce. Be specific! Give sample code if you can.
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happens
-   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Propose new features according to the goals of the project
This project solves one simple and common problem: displaying records from the Django database on a map.

For example, geodata processing functions or improvements in the Django admin panel.

All your suggestions for a more flexible and functional display of objects on the map are welcome.

## All code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.
[Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) perform quality checks for you code.

-   Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
-   If you've add/change/remove features, update the README.md.
-   If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. 100% test coverage is a fetish of the author of this code ;)
-   Ensure the test suite passes.
-   Make sure your code lints.
-   Issue that pull request!
